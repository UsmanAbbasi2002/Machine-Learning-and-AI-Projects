# Vehicle Counting on Highway using YOLOv8n

## 🚗 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a computer vision system that detects and counts **cars** on a highway using the **YOLOv8n** model. It works on a specific camera angle and video setup but can be adapted to other highway videos with minor adjustments.

## 📁 Files Included

* `Car_Counter_Project_File.ipynb`
  A Jupyter Notebook that contains all the necessary code for running the car detection and counting system.

* `Project_Output_Video.mp4`
  An example output video showing how the system detects and counts vehicles in a sample highway video.

These are the only files included in this project.

## ⚙️ How It Works

* The system uses the **YOLOv8n** model to detect **only cars** in each frame of the input video.
* Each detected car is enclosed in a **bounding box**, and a **red dot** is drawn at the center of the box.
* A virtual **horizontal line** is drawn in the middle of the screen.
* Whenever a red dot (i.e., car center) crosses this line, the system **increments the car counter**.

This simple and effective technique allows real-time vehicle monitoring and counting.

## ⚡ Dependencies

You will need to install the following libraries:

* `ultralytics`
* `opencv-python`
* `numpy`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add support for detecting and counting multiple vehicle types (e.g., trucks, buses, bikes).
* Extend the logic to adapt to different camera angles and traffic layouts.
* Implement CSV logging for storing vehicle counts over time.
* Visual dashboard or interface for real-time monitoring.
* Integrate with a live traffic feed for continuous monitoring.
