# Machine Learning and AI Projects

This repository contains a collection of small but practical **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence** projects that I have worked on.

These projects showcase the application of various ML models and computer vision techniques using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and popular libraries like scikit-learn, OpenCV, and Ultralytics YOLO.
